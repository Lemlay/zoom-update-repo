I was disappointed to find no legitmate repo for zoom, yeah they got privacy concerns and all, but I'm in a position where it is usally others deciding the meeting platform, so rather than risk outdated software, or burden myself with excessive checks that it is up to date, I created this simple script, vaguely based on something I saw, I'll reference if I rememberr, but run ./setup after cloning the repo, and it should do what's necessary to keep zoom up to date... I may try to edit this for other systems, but for now it's just for Fedora, because that's the system I'm on today :shouldershrug:
